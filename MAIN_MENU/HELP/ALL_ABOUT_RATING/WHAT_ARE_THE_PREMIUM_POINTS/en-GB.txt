These are paid points of the rating, which give a big advantage. For example, if one server has 1000 "free" points while another has 10 "free" and 1 paid (Premium points), then the second server has a higher position than the first one. In this case, "free" points are not considered at all.

This means that if only one server has Premium points, this server will take first place in the server lists.

This is a great way to popularize your server and attract players.

You can always buy Premium points for your server. To do this, go to your server page and click on the "Premium points:" in the "Rating" section on the right.
A dialog opens where you can see the current Premium points and buy new ones.

The validity of the Premium points is limited in time. At the time of writing, premium putties are valid for 30 days.

Why buy more than 1?
If it's important for you to be in first position, then your server should have at least one Premium point more than the rest of the servers.

All servers with Premium points are sorted by the number of valid Premium points in descending order.

In case two servers have the same number of premium points, "free" points are also compared.

Master server
In our master servers, which output a list of servers for client games, sorting is the same as in all lists.

ATTENTION! Premium points are valid only for 30 days. Then they expires.
